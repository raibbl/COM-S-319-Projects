1-Unzip homework2.zip to any place on your computer 
2-I used intellij idea community edition 2019.2 so all you have to do is open intellij
3-once intellij is open go to file>open and choose the extracted folder 
4-once the project loads, under project files there is a src folder 
5-in src folder there should be server.java and three copies of client, one name client.java , clientcopy & clientcopy1. 
6- the three client files are the same they are just to test multiple client log in and broadcast feature. 
7-right click on server and click on run, it should start running in a terminal in intellij
8- right click on client.java , clientcopy & clientcopy1  individually  and click on run, they  should start running in a terminal in intellij.
9-in the the client terminals you can enter your name and the access  code "cs319spring2020" and if everything is correct you will see a response from a server that tells you you are connected and other wise it will tell you to enter code again 
10-after you log in in all clients you can start typing in anyone of them and look at other clients and server to see that everything is being transmitted.
